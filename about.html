			<span class="redText">Grapes and Gasoline</span> is a brand created with, by,
			and because of <span class="redText">passion</span>. Two things, that don´t fit together in any way.
			Yet they have found a way in the same place. The <span class="redText">grapes</span> represent life,
			they are life, they grow, they are nourishment. After harvest, made into
			the most complex drink ever designed. Infinite combinations to bring the
			calm of nature in an expression of pure <span class="redText">passion and delight</span>. Next to <span class="redText">gasoline</span>,
			derived from <span class="redText">black gold</span>, ruling every single corner of the Earth, the power of
			a million horses trampling the steppes of freedom. Powering what man gives his own
			personal bit of nature´s strength. These are the two raw components that bring out
			the passion in a person. Put simple: wine and motorcycles.

			<span class="redText">G&G</span> is focussing on building a brand of its own. To do things we love, our focus is
			just like our name, very wide and perhaps not fitting together. That´s not what we think.
			<span class="redText">Photography</span> and <span class="redText">Graphic Design</span> is the first focus. We specialise in <span class="redText">product, commercial
			and advertising photography</span>. In addition to that, we do <span class="redText">all your graphic design work</span>,
			following up on our photography. <span class="redText">Horeca</span> is our second focus. As we try to expand our
			horizon in the <span class="redText">wine</span> business. This includes <span class="redText">bars</span> and <span class="redText">restaurants</span>, as well as future plans
			to <span class="redText">import</span> and <span class="redText">distribute</span>. If you have anything to ask, refer to our <a href="contact.html"><span style="color:#DB5A5A">contact form</span></a>.
